# Basic-Calculator embedded in Webpage
Using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The CSS design has been mostly inspired from: https://freshman.tech/css-grid-calculator/

It works exactly like the calculator you're used to:
- A display screen updated in real time after each input ;
- All 4 basics operators are supported (+,-,*,/) ;
- Decimals & negatives numbers are supported ;
- AC function to reset the calculator.


The pogram is divided into 3 files:
- The .html webpage ;
- The .js file which allow the calculator to work ;
- The .css which contains custom designs for the webpage.
